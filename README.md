# Hi, I'm Alexander 👋

### **Senior Java Engineer | Front Office E-Trading Veteran | AI-Native Explorer**

With over 15 years of experience architecting high-frequency, low-latency electronic trading systems at Tier-1 Investment Banks, I’ve built a career on the precision and stability required by global markets.

I am now bridging that mission-critical engineering mindset with the frontier of **Generative AI and Agentic Workflows.**

---

### What I’m Doing Now
I use this space as a personal lab to explore the **AI-Native development lifecycle**, focusing on how LLMs and autonomous agents can transform complex enterprise systems.

* **[System Diagnostics Copilot](https://github.com/jamesbond00/ai-copilot-public):** My flagship experimental project—an Enterprise Event Intelligence platform exploring Agentic workflows and explainable automation.
* **The AI Sandbox:** Experimenting with **Google Antigravity**, **Cursor**, and **Codex** to see how AI-driven tools can refactor and optimize robust Java architectures.
* **Orchestrating Intelligence:** Moving beyond "black box" AI to build systems that provide verifiable reasoning for diagnostic decisions.

### Tech Stack & Expertise
* **The Foundation:** Java (Expert - Multi-threading, Low Latency), Spring Boot/Cloud, Microservices, Messaging.
* **The Domain:** RFQ Engines, FIX Protocol, ION MarketView, OMS/EMS (Rates, FX, Equities).
* **The Frontier:** LLM Orchestration, Agentic Frameworks, Prompt Engineering for Enterprise Code.

### The Philosophy
I believe the next era of software engineering isn't just about writing code, but about **orchestrating intelligence**. This profile documents my journey of applying senior-level architectural rigor to the world of autonomous agents.

> *Note: These projects are personal experiments to learn new tech stacks and are independent of my professional employment.*
