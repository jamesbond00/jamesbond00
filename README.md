# Hi, I'm Alexander 👋

### **Senior Java Engineer | Front Office Trading Systems | Low-Latency & Reliability | Python | Open Source**

Senior engineer with 15+ years building low-latency, mission-critical front-office trading systems at Tier-1 investment banks (RFQ/OMS/FIX across Rates/FX/Equities). I focus on latency-sensitive flows, resiliency, and production ownership—where correctness, operational discipline, and rapid incident response directly matter.

I’m now extending that same engineering mindset into **LLM-powered diagnostics and agentic workflows**: systems that can turn noisy production signals into **structured, evidence-backed** explanations and next actions—while staying auditable and safe for real environments.

## What I’m Doing Now

I use this GitHub space as a practical lab for **production-grade AI in engineering workflows**—especially reliability, incident investigation, and developer productivity.

- **[Smart Enterprise Diagnostics (SED)](https://github.com/jamesbond00/ai-copilot-public)**: Open-source experiments in **LLM/agentic incident investigation** — timeline reconstruction, evidence-linked summaries, hypothesis ranking, and faster triage.
- **AI Tooling Workflow**: Experimenting with agentic IDEs and coding agents (e.g., Antigravity, Cursor, Codex) to stress-test where they help (and where they break) in real codebases and robust Java systems.
- **Verifiable Automation**: Moving beyond “black box” outputs — designing workflows with traceability, explicit assumptions, and reproducible steps.

## Tech Stack & Expertise

- **Core**: Java (expert), concurrency/multi-threading, low-latency patterns, performance tuning, production debugging.
- **Trading Domain**: RFQ engines, OMS/EMS, FIX, ION MarketView, front-office integrations (Rates/FX/Equities).
- **AI / Reliability**: LLM orchestration, agentic workflows, evaluation/guardrails, prompt+tool design for engineering systems.

## Philosophy

I’m interested in AI that **improves outcomes under production constraints**: measurable speed-ups in diagnosis, fewer repeated incidents, and better operational clarity—without sacrificing reliability.
